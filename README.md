# Lordu's Custom Dice for Dice So Nice!
Repo for the Dice So Nice Addon module

## About/How to use
This module can only be used in conjunction with Dice So Nice and adds two new systems, one containing custom labels for dark/vampire-type games and a second system which simple contains all other custom styles using new fonts. The fonts, textures and colorsets of this module are added automatically to the selection menu of DsN.

I plan to release more themes with future updates of this module.
