# Lordu's Custom Dice for Dice So Nice!
Repo for my small Dice So Nice! (DsN) dice addon module

## About/How to use
This module can only be used in conjunction with Dice So Nice! (minimum version required 3.1.0) and adds two new systems, one containing custom dice labelling for dark/horror-type games and a second system which simply contains all other custom styles using new fonts. The fonts, textures and colorsets of this module are added automatically to the selection menu of DsN.

I plan to release more themes with future updates of this module.
